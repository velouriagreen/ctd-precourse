# ctd-precourse project
This is a fun, small project that completes the CTD Precourse assignment requirements. 

In order to see the project in the browser, one must:

1. Clone and fork down the repository into machine via: https://github.com/velouriagreen/ctd-precourse.git

2. cd into the ctd-precourse folder and run npm install to ensure that all the necessary packages are present to help this project to run. 

3. Open up a terminal and run npm start to start the server. It should say "Listening from http://localhost:8701" when connected.

4. In another terminal run npm run dev to allow webpack to run it's thing. It should say "webpack 5.74.0 compiled successfully..." after compiling. 

5. Finally, go to your browser and type in localhost:8701 to see the project. 

May the force be with you!
